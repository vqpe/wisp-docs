# Nodes

## What is a Node?

The Node is basically the physical machine that is used to run your Server.

This means that if that Node goes down, any Server on it will also be down.
Every Node has its seperate IP, if one Node gets ratelimited, all Servers on that Node are affected, but other Nodes and their Servers remain completely unaffected.

A overview of all Nodes and their Status can be found at https://status.wispbyte.com/
